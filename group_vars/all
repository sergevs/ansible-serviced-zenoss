# the playbook can also be used to setup just the docker environment
# this variable has the same effect as delegate_use_nfs ( see below )
# both of variables impacts to the size of docker thin pool allocation:
# if only_docker set to true :
# - all thinpool space will be dedicated to docker
# - serviced ( zenoss control center ) will not be installed
# if only_docker set to false and delegate_use_nfs true
# - all thinpool space will be dedicated to docker
# if only_docker set to false and delegate_use_nfs false
# - thinpool space will be distributed equally
