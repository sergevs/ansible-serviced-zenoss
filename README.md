# ansible-serviced-zenoss
Ansible playbook to deploy docker, [serviced](https://github.com/control-center/serviced) and [zenoss monitoring system](https://www.zenoss.com)

# Overview
The primary purpose of the playbook is to prepare the environment which is required to run zenoss:
* deploy docker with lvm storage thin pool 
* deploy serviced according to [requirements](https://www.zenoss.com/services-support/documentation/cc-install-guide) optionally deploy a serviced cluster, which in the turn can be used to implement zenoss distributed monitoring
* deploy zenoss

# Configuration
The configuration options are documented at [group_vars](group_vars) files. You can amend variables there or override it [site_vars.yml](site_vars.yml)
Put hosts to the [hosts](hosts). It's possible to deploy only docker.

# Usage
After required configuration prepared you can use [setup](setup) script to start deployment.
```
  ./setup
```

# Requirements
At least one spare partition(>= 30 Gb) must be available and configured(**lvm_dev**) for docker and zenoss storage pools.
4 Gb RAM to run serviced services or 24 Gb to run zenoss

Supported OS:

* Debian Stretch
* Ubuntu Xenial

[ansible](https://www.ansible.com): 2.3.0

# Testing
The playbook tested for serviced 1.5.0 and zenoss 6.1.2. Google cloud host is used for deployment as a reproducible clean environment.
For a convenience [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) script is supplied, see [zenoss.tf](zenoss.tf)
